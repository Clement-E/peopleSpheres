This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Comments from candidate

I come from integration's (i have 10years XP in html/css) world and most recently (about 3years) for Angular world.
Even though javascript is javascript, my only contact with react was a few weeks on a small project using `React/Store/Redux/Axios` combo. It was 3 years ago :)

First of all, i found this kind of assessment pretty fun to do. It was a good exercice (made for juniors i believe...) to remember React syntax, reducer methods etc. 
React seems so light and fluid to manipulate compared to Angular.
Even if it's very readable for me i lack of "best practices" in React and i'm not sure i am able to suggest more relevant refactoring than doing one file from `add/updateFormContainer.js` because of DRY and doing a `map()` of `formGroupItems` in `product.js`...
BUT, i can tell that i'm missed `Typecript` implementation a lot reading this code! ^^

Thank you for your reading and i'm hoping forward your comments
